An Arduino port of the tinkerer.eu library. It works with the Sparkfun nRF24L01+ modules.

This is a fork of the original "Mirf" library by Aaron Shrimpton:
http://github.com/aaronds/arduino-nrf24l01/

This fork includes the following changes:
* Added support for the SPI85 library on ATtiny85 chips.
* Compatible with ATmega and ATtiny chips (tested with ATtiny85).
* Can connect to devices using the RF24 library by setting
  "Mirf.baseConfig = _BV(EN_CRC) | _BV(CRCO);" before calling
  "Mirf.config();".
* Reduced binary size.

Other information:
* This library supports changing less popular registers without
  having to "hack" the libraries code. An example for changing
  the RF_SETUP register:
  "Mirf.configRegister(RF_SETUP, _BV(RF_DR_LOW));"
